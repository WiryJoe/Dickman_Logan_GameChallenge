# Dickman_Logan_GameChallenge

This is a very old C# project I made at the start of my school time. I am uploading it now on someone's advice in order to make my github profile more... alive I guess?
I will try an fix some bugs I know exist if I find some time, but not entirely sure if that will happen.
Anyways, enjoy some of my work from when I wasn't so burnt out on school yet haha.

For the moment you will need to have visual studios (or some other terminal) installed in order for it to work.
I'll try and make it more accessable but for now it is dependant on it so keep that in mind.
