# Dickman_Logan_GameChallenge

This is a simple terminal program that I used to demonstrate my capabilties with C# source code. It has turn based combat, stats, equipment, abilities, progression, randomization, boss fights, and more.
I spent a lot of time over just a few days to make it, figuring out very quickly how to develop the soft skills necessary for successful coding projects.
I learned about how to add and adjust new features to a program, a proccess of finding and fixing bugs and errors, balancing and fun factor, as well as the general organization of file structures in general.
Fortunately, since this project, I have leaarnt even better file management so I can see it is a bit cluttered in places with my now more experienced eyes, but it still works well.

Eventually I will go in and clean up the structure and see if I can't spot some of the more obscure bugs, but for now it stands as I think en effort I can be proud of, especially as I was able to make it all
in only about 3 days (and I definitely felt the pressure, I can tell you that, haha).

Hopefully you'll like it or at least find some interest in it. If there are any issues you find with it please let me know so I can look for it when I have the time to clean it up.
